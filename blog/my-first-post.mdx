This is my first blog post. I thought I would use this talk about
the origin and purpose behind this site, and how it will be used in the coming years. 

In the summer of 2020, my stepdad asked me if I could design and implement
a personal website for him. He works as a graphic designer, so he thought it would
be valuable to showcase his digital portfolio to the world through a website.

With about a year of coding experience under my belt, and having only taken one web development course (in which I 
may or may not have slacked off), I spent a few days working on the site using only vanilla HTML and CSS. Since he wanted to 
simply display static media, there was technically no need to make the website responsive beyond a few links, and therefore 
no need to use a responsive data layer, or even JavaScript. It was meant for exposition, not interaction. 

The computer science student in me knew that making a beautiful, yet unresponsive website was like 
cooking a delicious meal, except when you bite into it, it doesn't taste like anything. Working on this vanilla website forced 
me to ask questions that I would only be able to answer once I gained more experience with web and application development: 
How do you make a website actually do something? How do you pull data from foreign sources, and how do you organize that data? How 
do you display that data on an interface, and how do you connect events on an interface to backend procedures? 

I like to think of this personal website as my answer to all of those questions. This site was built using GatsbyJS, GraphQL, React, and 
many other tools that I only saw as mysterious acronyms a few years ago. As somebody who began to code in January 2019, I am no stranger to 
imposter syndrome. In fact, I will probably make a blog post about it in the future. It is difficult to turn that lack of belonging into 
a fire to drive learning, whether that is in the classroom, or independently, but this site is exactly that. I hope that you all enjoy it.
